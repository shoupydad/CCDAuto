How to unpack SBIG's kernel driver compressed file.
======================================================
tar xzvf LinuxDevKit 

The 'sbig' directory is created and contains all files
from the distribution.
======================================================
How to install SBIG's Linux kernel modules.
======================================================
su
cd sbig
./load_lpt  for LPT drivers
./load_usb  for USB drivers

You may see some warnings, but that's normal:

Warning: loading ./modsbiglpt.o will taint the kernel: no license
Warning: loading ./modsbiglpt.o will taint the kernel: forced load

You can check installed driver.
less /proc/devices
cd /dev
ls -l sbiglpt*
You should see 3 devices named sbiglpt0-2,
each dedicated to one LPT port [0-2]

To remove modules from the memory, run scripts:
./unload_lpt
./unload_usb
======================================================
How to use install the shared libraries.
======================================================
su
cd sbig
cp *.so /usr/local/lib

Set environment LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

How to activate the hotplug for SBIG USB cameras.
======================================================
Check if your distribution contains fxload application
which uploads the SBIG's firmware into your USB camera.
The file should be located at:

ls /sbin/fxload

If not, visit the following web pages:

http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net

select the USB page and download the latest version
of the fxload file into /sbin directory.

Move all SBIG's firmware files *.hex to 
/usr/share/usb directory.

Check your /etc/hotplug/usb.usermap file and

add exactly (!) one line which is in our distribution
of hotplug/sbig.usermap. 

If your usb.usermap is empty, simply rename our 
sbig.usermap file to usb.usermap and move it
to the /etc/hotplug/ directory.

Change mode of 'sbig' script and copy to the location:
chmod +x sbig 
cp sbig /etc/hotplug/usb/

Run /sbin/depmod -a
   
If everything is all right, when you turn ON your
USB camera, the firmware should be automatically
uploaded and after 10-15 seconds you should see and 
hear the camera's fan working. If not check the 
usb.usermap file. All the numbers must be in the 
hexadecimal notation, especially for older distributions.
After downloading the firmware, your camera should
be used by your application.
======================================================
Making the test application (optional) 
======================================================
Included are three cpp files (main.cpp, csbigcam.cpp,
and csbigimg.cpp) and a make file that allow you to 
build a simple test application. Run make then run
the test application:

make
./testapp

There are main.cpp and sbigcam.cpp you should use
for your first playing with the driver.
