4.2.3 Output File Name when Opening an Existing File</A>
</H2>

<P>
An optional output filename may be specified in parentheses immediately
following the base file name to be opened.  This is mainly useful in
those cases where CFITSIO creates a temporary copy of the input FITS
file before it is opened and passed to the application program.  This
happens by default when opening a network FTP or HTTP-type file, when
reading a compressed FITS file on a local disk, when reading from the
stdin stream, or when a column filter, row filter, or binning specifier
is included as part of the input file specification.  By default this
temporary file is created in memory.  If there is not enough memory to
create the file copy, then CFITSIO will exit with an error.   In these
cases one can force a permanent file to be created on disk, instead of
a temporary file in memory, by supplying the name in parentheses
immediately following the base file name.  The output filename can
include the '!' clobber flag.

<P>
Thus, if the input filename to CFITSIO is:
 
<PRE>
    file1.fits.gz(file2.fits)
</PRE>then CFITSIO will uncompress `file1.fits.gz' into the local disk file
`file2.fits' before opening it.  CFITSIO does not automatically delete
the output file, so it will still exist after the application program
exits.

<P>
In some cases, several different temporary FITS files will be created
in sequence, for instance, if one opens a remote file using FTP, then
filters rows in a binary table extension, then create an image by
binning a pair of columns.  In this case, the remote file will be
copied to a temporary local file, then a second temporary file will be
created containing the filtered rows of the table, and finally a third
temporary file containing the binned image will be created.  In cases
like this where multiple files are created, the outfile specifier will
be interpreted the name of the final file as described below, in descending
priority:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>
as the name of the final image file if an image within a single binary
table cell is opened or if an image is created by binning a table column.
<LI>
as the name of the file containing the filtered table if a column filter
and/or a row filter are specified.
<LI>
as the name of the local copy of the remote FTP or HTTP file.
<LI>
as the name of the uncompressed version of the FITS file, if a
compressed FITS file on local disk has been opened.
<LI>
otherwise, the output filename is ignored.
</UL>
<P>
The output file specifier is useful when reading FTP or HTTP-type
FITS files since it can be used to create a local disk copy of the file
that can be reused in the future.  If the output file name = `*' then a
local file with the same name as the network file will be created.
Note that CFITSIO will behave differently depending on whether the
remote file is compressed or not as shown by the following examples:
<UL>
<LI>
`ftp://remote.machine/tmp/myfile.fits.gz(*)' - the remote compressed
file is copied to the local compressed file `myfile.fits.gz', which
is then uncompressed in local memory before being opened and passed
to the application program.

<P>
<LI>
`ftp://remote.machine/tmp/myfile.fits.gz(myfile.fits)' - the remote
compressed file is copied and uncompressed into the local file
`myfile.fits'.  This example requires less local memory than the
previous example since the file is uncompressed on disk instead of
in memory.

<P>
<LI>
`ftp://remote.machine/tmp/myfile.fits(myfile.fits.gz)' - this will
usually produce an error since CFITSIO itself cannot compress files.
</UL>
<P>
The exact behavior of CFITSIO in the latter case depends on the type of
ftp server running on the remote machine and how it is configured.  In
some cases, if the file `myfile.fits.gz' exists on the remote machine,
then the server will copy it to the local machine.  In other cases the
ftp server will automatically create and transmit a compressed version
of the file if only the uncompressed version exists.  This can get
rather confusing, so users should use a certain amount of caution when
using the output file specifier with FTP or HTTP file types, to make
sure they get the behavior that they expect.
