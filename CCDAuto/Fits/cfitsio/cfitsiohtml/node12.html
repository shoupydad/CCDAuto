<P>
In order to effectively use the CFITSIO library as quickly as possible,
it is recommended that new users follow these steps:

<P>
1.  Read the following `FITS Primer' chapter for an overview of the
structure of FITS files.  This is especially important for users who
are unfamiliar with the FITS table and image extensions.

<P>
2. Review the various topics discussed in Chapters 4 and 5 to become
familiar with the conventions and advanced features of the CFITSIO
interface.

<P>
3.  Refer to the cookbook.c, listhead.c, and fitscopy.c programs that
are included with this release for examples of routines that perform
various common FITS file operations.  Type 'make program_name' to compile
and link these programs on Unix systems.

<P>
4.  Write a simple program to read or write a FITS file using the Basic
Interface routines described in Chapter 7.

<P>
5.  Scan through the more specialized routines that are described in
Chapter 8 to become familiar with the functionality that they provide.
