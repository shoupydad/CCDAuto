5.2 CFITSIO Size Limitations</A>
</H1>

<P>
CFITSIO places few restrictions on the size of FITS files that it
reads or writes.  There are a few limits, however, which may affect
some extreme cases:

<P>
1.  The maximum number of files that may be simultaneously opened is
limited to the number of internal IO buffers allocated in CFITSIO
(currently 25, as defined by NIOBUF in the file fitsio2.h), or by the
limit of the underlying C compiler or machine operating system, which
ever is smaller.  The C symbolic constant FOPEN_MAX usually defines
the total number of files that may open at once (this includes any
other text or binary files which may be open, not just FITS files).

<P>
2.  The maximum number of extensions (HDUs) that can be read or written
in a single FITS file is currently set to 1000 as defined by MAXHDU in
the fitsio.h file.  This value may be increased if necessary, but the
access times to the later extensions in such files may become excessively
long.

<P>
3.  By default, CFITSIO can handle FITS files up to 2.1 GB in size
(2**31 bytes).  This file size limit is often imposed by 32-bit
operating systems.  More recently, as 64-bit operating systems become
more common, an industry-wide standard (at least on Unix systems) has
been developed to support larger sized files (see
http://ftp.sas.com/standards/large.file/).  Starting with version 2.1
of CFITSIO, larger FITS files up to 6 terabytes in size may be read and
written on certain supported platforms.  In order to support these
larger files, CFITSIO must be compiled with the
`-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64' compiler flag.  All programs which link to
the CFITSIO library must also be compiled with this flag or must
include this preprocessor definition at the start of the source code
file.  This causes the compiler to allocate 8-bytes instead of 4-bytes
for the `off_t' datatype which is used to store file offset
positions.

<P>
If CFITSIO is compiled with the -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 flag on a
platform that supports large files, then it can read and write FITS
files that contain up to 2**31 2880-byte FITS records, or approximately
6 terabytes in size.  It is still required that the value of the NAXISn
and PCOUNT keywords in each extension be within the range of a signed
4-byte integer (max value = 2,147,483,648).  Thus, each dimension of an
image (given by the NAXISn keywords), the total width of a table
(NAXIS1 keyword), the number of rows in a table (NAXIS2 keyword), and
the total size of the variable-length array heap in binary tables
(PCOUNT keyword) must be less than this limit.

<P>
Currently, support for large files within CFITSIO has only been tested
on the Solaris 2.6 operating system using the Sun cc compiler or gcc
2.95.2.
