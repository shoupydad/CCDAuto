2.1.1  Unix Systems</A>
</H2>

<P>
The CFITSIO library is built on Unix systems by typing:
 
<PRE>
   &gt; ./configure
   &gt; make
</PRE>at the operating system prompt.  Type ./configure and not simply
`configure' to ensure that the configure script in the current
directory is run and not some other system-wide configure script.  The
configure command customizes the Makefile for the particular system,
then the `make' command compiles the source files and builds the
library.

<P>
On HP/UX systems, the environment variable CFLAGS should be set
to -Ae before running configure to enable "extended ANSI" features.

<P>
By default, a set of Fortran-callable wrapper routines are
also built and included in the CFITSIO library.  If these wrapper
routines are not needed (i.e., the CFITSIO library will not
be linked to any Fortran applications which call FITSIO subroutines)
then they may be omitted from the build by typing 'make all-nofitsio'
instead of simply typing 'make'.  This will reduce the size
of the CFITSIO library slightly.

<P>
Most 32-bit operating systems have only supported disk files up to
2.1GB (2**31 bytes) in size.  Starting with version 2.1 of CFITSIO,
FITS files larger than this limit (up to 6 terabytes) can be read and
written on platforms which support large files (e.g., Solaris).  To
enable this feature, CFITSIO must be compiled with the
`-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64' compiler flag.  All programs which link to
the CFITSIO library must also be compiled with this flag or must
include this preprocessor definition at the start of the source code
file. See the `CFITSIO Size Limitations' section in Chapter 5 for
further details.

<P>
It may not be possible to staticly link programs that use CFITSIO on
some platforms (namely, on Solaris 2.6) due to the network drivers
(which provide FTP and HTTP access to FITS files).  It is possible to
make both a dynamic and a static version of the CFITSIO library, but
network file access will not be possible using the static version.  To
build the dynamic libcfitsio.so library (on solaris), type 'make
clean', then edit the Makefile to add -fPIC or -KPIC (gcc or cc) to the
CFLAGS line, then rebuild the library with 'make'.  Once you're done,
build the shared library with
 
<PRE>
 ld -G -z text -o libcfitsio.so *.o
</PRE>Then to get the staticly linkable libcfitsio.a library file do another
make clean, undefine HAVE_NET_SERVICES on the CFLAGS line and rebuild.
It's unimportant whether or not you use -fPIC for static builds.

<P>
When using the shared library the executable code is not copied into
your program at link time and instead the program locates the necessary
library code at run time, normally through LD_LIBRARY_PATH or some
other method.  The advantages are:
 
<PRE>
   1.  Less disk space if you build more than 1 program
   2.  Less memory if more than one copy of a program using the shared
       library is running at the same time since the system is smart
       enough to share copies of the shared library at run time.
   3.  Possibly easier maintenance since a new version of the shared
       library can be installed without relinking all the software
       that uses it (as long as the subroutine names and calling
       sequences remain unchanged).
   4.  No run-time penalty.
</PRE>The disadvantages are:
 
<PRE>
   1. More hassle at runtime.  You have to either build the programs
      specially or have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set right.
   2. There may be a slight start up penality, depending on where you are
      reading the shared library and the program from and if your CPU is
      either really slow or really heavily loaded.
</PRE>
