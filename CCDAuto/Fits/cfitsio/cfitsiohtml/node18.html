4.1 Overview</A>
</H1>

<P>
CFITSIO supports an extended syntax when specifying the name of the
data file to be opened or created  that includes the following
features:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>
CFITSIO can read IRAF format images which have header file names that
end with the '.imh' extension, as well as reading and writing FITS
files,   This feature is implemented in CFITSIO by first converting the
IRAF image into a temporary FITS format file in memory, then opening
the FITS file.  Any of the usual CFITSIO routines then may be used to
read the image header or data.

<P>
<LI>
FITS files on the internet can be read (and sometimes written) using the FTP,
HTTP, or ROOT protocols.

<P>
<LI>
FITS files can be piped between tasks on the stdin and stdout streams.

<P>
<LI>
FITS files can be read and written in shared memory.  This can potentially
achieve much better data I/O performance compared to reading and
writing the same FITS files on magnetic disk.

<P>
<LI>
Compressed FITS files in gzip or Unix COMPRESS format can be directly read.

<P>
<LI>
FITS table columns can be created, modified, or deleted 'on-the-fly' as
the table is opened by CFITSIO.  This creates a virtual FITS file containing
the modifications that is then opened by the application program.

<P>
<LI>
Table rows may be selected, or filtered out, on the fly when the table
is opened by CFITSIO, based on an arbitrary user-specified expression.
Only rows for which the expression evaluates to 'TRUE' are retained
in the copy of the table that is opened by the application program.

<P>
<LI>
Histogram images may be created on the fly by binning the values in
table columns, resulting in a virtual N-dimensional FITS image.  The
application program then only sees the FITS image (in the primary
array) instead of the original FITS table.
</UL>
<P>
The latter 3 features in particular add very powerful data processing
capabilities directly into CFITSIO, and hence into every task that uses
CFITSIO to read or write FITS files.  For example, these features
transform a very simple program that just copies an input FITS file to
a new output file (like the `fitscopy' program that is distributed with
CFITSIO) into a multipurpose FITS file processing tool.  By appending
fairly simple qualifiers onto the name of the input FITS file, the user
can perform quite complex table editing operations (e.g., create new
columns, or filter out rows in a table) or create FITS images by
binning or histogramming the values in table columns.  In addition,
these functions have been coded using new state-of-the art algorithms
that are, in some cases, 10 - 100 times faster than previous widely
used implementations.

<P>
Before describing the complete syntax for the extended FITS file names
in the next section, here are a few examples of FITS file names that
give a quick overview of the allowed syntax:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<TT>'myfile.fits'</TT>: the simplest case of a FITS file on disk in the current
directory.

<P>
<LI>
<TT>'myfile.imh'</TT>: opens an IRAF format image file and converts it on the
fly into a temporary FITS format image in memory which can then be read with
any other CFITSIO routine.

<P>
<LI>
<TT>'myfile.fits.gz[events, 2]'</TT>:  opens and uncompresses the gzipped file
myfile.fits then moves to the extension which has the keywords EXTNAME
= 'EVENTS' and EXTVER = 2.

<P>
<LI>
<TT>'-'</TT>:  a dash (minus sign) signifies that the input file is to be read
from the stdin file stream, or that the output file is to be written to
the stdout stream.

<P>
<LI>
<TT>'ftp://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/test/vela.fits'</TT>:  FITS files in any ftp
archive site on the internet may be directly opened with read-only
access.

<P>
<LI>
<TT>'http://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/software/test.fits'</TT>: any valid URL to a
FITS file on the Web may be opened with read-only access.

<P>
<LI>
<TT>'root://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/test/vela.fits'</TT>: similar to ftp access
except that it provides write as well as read access to the files
across the network. This uses the root protocol developed at CERN.

<P>
<LI>
<TT>'shmem://h2[events]'</TT>: opens the FITS file in a shared memory segment and
moves to the EVENTS extension.

<P>
<LI>
<TT>'mem://'</TT>:  creates a scratch output file in core computer memory.  The
resulting 'file' will disappear when the program exits, so this
is mainly useful for testing purposes when one does not want a
permanent copy of the output file.

<P>
<LI>
<TT>'myfile.fits[3; Images(10)]'</TT>: opens a copy of the image contained in the
10th row of the 'Images' column in the binary table in the 3th extension
of the FITS file.  The application just sees this single image as the
primary array.

<P>
<LI>
<TT>'myfile.fits[1:512:2, 1:512:2]'</TT>: opens a section of the input image
ranging from the 1st to the 512th pixel in  X and Y, and selects every
second pixel in both dimensions, resulting in a 256 x 256 pixel image
in this case.

<P>
<LI>
<TT>'myfile.fits[EVENTS][col Rad = sqrt(X**2 + Y**2)]'</TT>:  creates and opens
a temporary file on the fly (in memory or on disk) that is identical to
myfile.fits except that it will contain a new column in the EVENTS
extension called 'Rad' whose value is computed using the indicated
expresson which is a function of the values in the X and Y columns.

<P>
<LI>
<TT>'myfile.fits[EVENTS][PHA &gt; 5]'</TT>:  creates and opens a temporary FITS
files that is identical to 'myfile.fits' except that the EVENTS table
will only contain the rows that have values of the PHA column greater
than 5.  In general, any arbitrary boolean expression using a C or
Fortran-like syntax, which may combine AND and OR operators,
may be used to select rows from a table.

<P>
<LI>
<TT>'myfile.fits[EVENTS][bin (X,Y)=1,2048,4]'</TT>:  creates a temporary FITS
primary array image which is computed on the fly by binning (i.e,
computing the 2-dimensional histogram) of the values in the X and Y
columns of the EVENTS extension.  In this case the X and Y coordinates
range from 1 to 2048 and the image pixel size is 4 units in both
dimensions, so the resulting image is 512 x 512 pixels in size.

<P>
<LI>
The final example combines many of these feature into one complex
expression (it is broken into several lines for clarity):
 
<PRE>
  'ftp://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/sample.fits.gz[EVENTS]
   [col phacorr = pha * 1.1 - 0.3][phacorr &gt;= 5.0 &amp;&amp; phacorr &lt;= 14.0]
   [bin (X,Y)=32]'
</PRE>In this case, CFITSIO (1) copies and uncompresses the FITS file from
the ftp site on the legacy machine, (2) moves to the 'EVENTS'
extension, (3) calculates a new column called 'phacorr', (4) selects
the rows in the table that have phacorr in the range 5 to 14, and
finally (5) bins the remaining rows on the X and Y column coordinates,
using a pixel size = 32 to create a 2D image.  All this processing is
completely transparent to the application program, which simply sees
the final 2-D image in the primary array of the opened file.
