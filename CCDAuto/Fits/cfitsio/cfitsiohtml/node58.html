<P>
1.  When dealing with a FITS primary array or IMAGE extension, it is
more efficient to read or write large chunks of the  image at a time
(at least 3 FITS blocks = 8640 bytes) so that the direct IO mechanism
will be used as described in the previous section.  Smaller chunks of
data are read or written via the IO buffers, which is somewhat less
efficient because of the extra copy operation and additional
bookkeeping steps that are required.  In principle it is more efficient
to read or write as big an array of image pixels at one time as
possible, however, if the array becomes so large that the operating
system cannot store it all in RAM, then the performance may be degraded
because of the increased swapping of virtual memory to disk.

<P>
2.  When dealing with FITS tables, the most important efficiency factor
in the software design is to read or write the data in the FITS file in
a single pass through the file.  An example of poor program design
would be to read a large, 3-column table by sequentially reading the
entire first column, then going back to read the 2nd column, and
finally the 3rd column; this obviously requires 3 passes through the
file which could triple the execution time of an IO limited program.
For small tables this is not important, but when reading multi-megabyte
sized tables these inefficiencies can become significant.  The more
efficient procedure in this case is to read or write only as many rows
of the table as will fit into the available internal IO buffers, then
access all the necessary columns of data within that range of rows.
Then after the program is completely finished with the data in those
rows it can move on to the next range of rows that will fit in the
buffers, continuing in this way until the entire file has been
processed.  By using this procedure of accessing all the columns of a
table in parallel rather than sequentially, each block of the FITS file
will only be read or written once.

<P>
The optimal number of rows to read or write at one time in a given
table depends on the width of the table row, on the number of IO
buffers that have been allocated in CFITSIO, and also on the number of
other FITS files that are open at the same time (since one IO buffer is
always reserved for each open FITS file).  Fortunately, a CFITSIO
routine is available that will return the optimal number of rows for a
given table:  fits_get_rowsize.  It is not critical to use exactly
the value of nrows returned by this routine, as long as one does not
exceed it.  Using a very small value however can also lead to poor
performance because of the overhead from the larger number of
subroutine calls.

<P>
The optimal number of rows returned by fits_get_rowsize is valid only
as long as the application program is only reading or writing data in
the specified table.  Any other calls to access data in the table
header or in any other FITS file would  cause additional blocks of data
to be loaded into the IO buffers displacing data from the original
table, and should be avoided during the critical period while the table
is being read or written.

<P>
Occasionally it is necessary to simultaneously access more than one
FITS table, for example when transferring values from an input table to
an output table.  In cases like this, one should call
fits_get_rowsize to get the optimal number of rows for each table
separately, than reduce the number of rows proportionally.  For
example, if the optimal number of rows in the input table is 3600 and
is 1400 in the output table, then these values should be cut in half to
1800 and 700, respectively, if both tables are going to be accessed at
the same time.

<P>
3.  Use binary table extensions rather than ASCII table
extensions for better efficiency  when dealing with tabular data.  The
I/O to ASCII tables is slower because of the overhead in formatting or
parsing the ASCII data fields and because ASCII tables are about twice
as large as binary tables with the same information content.

<P>
4. Design software so that it reads the FITS header keywords in the
same order in which they occur in the file.  When reading keywords,
CFITSIO searches forward starting from the position of the last keyword
that was read.  If it reaches the end of the header without finding the
keyword, it then goes back to the start of the header and continues the
search down to the position where it started.  In practice, as long as
the entire FITS header can fit at one time in the available internal IO
buffers, then the header keyword access will be very fast and it makes
little difference which order they are accessed.

<P>
5. Avoid the use of scaling (by using the BSCALE and BZERO or TSCAL and
TZERO keywords) in FITS files since the scaling operations add to the
processing time needed to read or write the data.  In some cases it may
be more efficient to temporarily turn off the scaling (using fits_set_bscale or
fits_set_tscale) and then read or write the raw unscaled values in the FITS
file.

<P>
6. Avoid using the `implicit datatype conversion' capability in
CFITSIO.  For instance, when reading a FITS image with BITPIX = -32
(32-bit floating point pixels), read the data into a single precision
floating point data array in the program.  Forcing CFITSIO to convert
the data to a different datatype can slow the program.

<P>
7. Where feasible, design FITS binary tables using vector column
elements so that the data are written as a contiguous set of bytes,
rather than as single elements in multiple rows.  For example, it is
faster to access the data in a table that contains a single row
and 2 columns with TFORM keywords equal to  '10000E' and '10000J', than
it is to access the same amount of data in a table with 10000 rows
which has columns with the TFORM keywords equal to '1E' and '1J'.  In
the former case the 10000 floating point values in the first column are
all written in a contiguous block of the file which can be read or
written quickly, whereas in the second case each floating point value
in the first column is interleaved with the integer value in the second
column of the same row so CFITSIO has to explicitly move to the
position of each element to be read or written.

<P>
8. Avoid the use of variable length vector columns in binary tables,
since any reading or writing of these data requires that CFITSIO first
look up or compute the starting address of each row of data in the
heap.

<P>
9. When copying data from one FITS table to another, it is faster to
transfer the raw bytes instead of reading then writing each column of
the table.  The CFITSIO routines fits_read_tblbytes and
fits_write_tblbytes will perform low-level reads or writes of any
contiguous range of bytes in a table extension.  These routines can be
used to read or write a whole row (or multiple rows  for even greater
efficiency) of a table with a single function call.   These routines
are fast because they bypass all the usual data scaling, error checking
and machine dependent data conversion that is normally done by CFITSIO,
and they allow the program to write the data to the output file in
exactly the same byte order.  For these same reasons, these routines
can corrupt the FITS data file if used incorrectly because no
validation or machine dependent conversion is performed by these
routines.  These routines are only recommended for optimizing critical
pieces of code and should only be used by programmers who thoroughly
understand the internal format of the FITS tables they are reading or
writing.

<P>
10. Another strategy for improving the speed of writing a FITS table,
similar to the previous one, is to directly construct the entire byte
stream for a whole table row (or multiple rows) within the application
program and then write it to the FITS file with
fits_write_tblbytes.  This avoids all the overhead normally present
in the column-oriented CFITSIO write routines.  This technique should
only be used for critical applications, because it makes the code more
difficult to understand and maintain, and it makes the code more system
dependent (e.g., do the bytes need to be swapped before writing to the
FITS file?).

<P>
11.  Finally, external factors such as the type of magnetic disk
controller (SCSI or IDE), the size of the disk cache, the average seek
speed of the disk, the amount of disk fragmentation, and the amount of
RAM available on the system can all have a significant impact on
overall I/O efficiency.  For critical applications, a system
administrator should review the proposed system hardware to identify any
potential I/O bottlenecks.
